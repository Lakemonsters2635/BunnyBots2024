## Future investigations

* Figure out how we generate trajectory and if `TrajGenerator.java` is helpful or how we do it in FRC2024 is better.
* Figure out if we actually need to set `isRedAlliance` to false in `DrivetrainSubsystem.createPath()`  
* Figure out if we can simplify the multiplying by * -1 later in `DrivetrainSubsystem.drive()`
* Fix Documentation on LoggingState, actualLoggingState, and Advantage Scope in `DrivetrainSybsystem.periodic()`
